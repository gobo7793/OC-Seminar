	abstract = "The goal of designing an optimal nearest neighbor classifier is to maximize the classification accuracy while minimizing the sizes of both the reference and feature sets. A novel intelligent genetic algorithm (IGA) superior to conventional \{GAs\} in solving large parameter optimization problems is used to effectively achieve this goal. It is shown empirically that the IGA-designed classifier outperforms existing GA-based and non-GA-based classifiers in terms of classification accuracy and total number of parameters of the reduced sets.
